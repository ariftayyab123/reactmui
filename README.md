# Getting Started with Create React App and Spring Boot Microservices

This project was initially bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is being extended with advanced integrations. The front-end leverages **Material UI (MUI)** for modern, responsive design, while the backend will be powered by **Spring Boot microservices**, ensuring scalability and robustness. The connection between the frontend and backend will be handled seamlessly, providing a clean and efficient communication layer for your application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes, allowing for rapid development. Any linting errors will also be shown in the console for easy debugging.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
This will help you monitor any tests you're running as you build out the frontend. See the section on [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

This command will build your React app for production. It optimizes the build for the best performance, minifying the files and including the hashed filenames for cache busting. The result will be a production-ready `build` folder, ready to be deployed.

Your app will now be prepared for integration with your **Spring Boot microservices backend**, offering a clean and robust setup for full-stack deployment.

### `npm run eject`

If you need to take full control over the configuration files (e.g., Webpack, Babel), use this command. **Note: This is a one-way operation and cannot be undone!** It copies all configurations into your project, allowing complete customization of your development environment.

## Backend Integration with Spring Boot Microservices

As part of this project, the backend services will be built using **Spring Boot microservices**. This architecture will allow us to:
- Easily scale the backend components.
- Ensure separation of concerns across services like authentication, user management, and data processing.
- Securely and efficiently connect to the React frontend using REST APIs or WebSockets.

We will also configure a seamless connection between the frontend and backend using tools like Axios or Fetch, which allows React to communicate with Spring Boot microservices effectively.

## Learn More

- For React development, refer to the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
- Learn more about Material UI components and styling from the [Material UI documentation](https://mui.com/).
- Explore **Spring Boot** for backend services through the [Spring Boot documentation](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

With these powerful tools, we will build a modern, scalable, and efficient full-stack web application. Happy coding!
